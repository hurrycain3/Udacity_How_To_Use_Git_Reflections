#1 What is UNIX?

Unix is a operating system that comes in different types. These different types share common similarities.
The most popular varieties are Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux, and MacOS X.

#2 What parts does UNIX have?

The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts: the kernel, the shell and the programs.

#3 What is the kernel?

The kernel is the core of the operating system. It allocates time and memory to programs and handles the filestore and
communications in response to system calls.

#4 What is the shell?

The sehll is the interface between the user and the kernel. It is a command line interpreter (CLI). It interpretes the
commands typed in and arranges them to be carried out. The commands are themselves programs. The user can customise his
shell and can use differentshells on the same machine.

#5 How do the kernel and the shell work together?

If a user types in a command the shell searches the filestore for the file containing the program and then requests the kernel
through system calls to execute the program. When the process has finished running the shell returns the UNIX prompt % indicating
that it is waiting for further commands.

#6 What else to know?

In UNIX everything is either a file or a process. A file is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process identifier).
A file is a collection of data, e.g. a document, text of a program written in a programming language, a collection of binary digits
(an executable or binary file), or directories.
