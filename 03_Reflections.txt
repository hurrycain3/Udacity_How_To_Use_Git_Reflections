#1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A remote repository gives flexibility. I don't need my local machine to work on files
instead I can work from anywhere I can access this remote repository from. In addition,
it makes collaboration with other more easy. It is also good for open source projects 
and for sharing code with the community.

#2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
